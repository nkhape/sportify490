## Welcome to Sportify 👋

This was the final project of the Le Wagon coding bootcamp. 💻
These are the team members, who have created the app:

1. [Camille](https://github.com/camille-celine)
2. [Sebastian](https://github.com/Sebastianbrd)
3. [Ioan-Andrey](https://github.com/Ioan93Andrei)
4. [Nick](https://github.com/nkhape)


Sportify aims to solve the pain of people, who would like to play a sports, but don't have anyone to play it with. For example an expat, who recently moved from Toronto to Sydney and loves playing tennis, but hasn't met anyone in Sydney yet, who he can play with. 🥎

Sportify allows users to search (using filters e.g. location, skill level, date, sport,...) for sports events, which they can then join. They are also able to create their own events and accept / reject other users, who want to join. Users can then rate players, who they've played with. There's also a messaging feature that lets people ask questions about an event. 🙌


Here's a sneak peak of what the app looks like:
